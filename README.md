An interactive map showing delays between United Airlines Hubs. Coordinates for United Airlines' 8 domestic hubs was scraped off the web and plotted on a map. Using data available from the FAA about flight delays and passenger volumes we created graphs to visualize just how bad delays and flight cancellations are at each of these hubs. A word of advise: avoid O'Hare if you can!
